which gh
```

**If not installed:**

Mac:
```bash
brew install gh
```

Linux:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh
```

Windows:
```powershell
winget install --id GitHub.cli
```

**AI executes:**
```bash
gh auth login
```

**User action:** 
1. Select "GitHub.com"
2. Select "HTTPS"
3. Authenticate with browser
4. Confirm in browser

**AI verification:**

gh auth status
# Should show: Logged in to github.com as username
```

**AI creates repository:**
```bash
gh repo create PROJECT_NAME --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

**Expected output:**
```
✓ Created repository username/PROJECT_NAME on GitHub
✓ Added remote origin
✓ Pushed commits to github.com/username/PROJECT_NAME.git
```

**Option B: Manual creation**

If GitHub CLI not available or fails:

**AI instructs user:**
```
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: PROJECT_NAME
3. Description: [Optional]
4. Visibility: Public
5. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
6. Click "Create repository"
7. Copy the repository URL shown
```

**AI asks:** "Please paste the GitHub repository URL:"

**AI executes:**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/PROJECT_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**AI verification:**
```bash
git remote -v
# Should show origin URL

git branch
# Should show * main
```

**AI checks GitHub:**
```bash
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/username/PROJECT_NAME | grep -q '"name"'
# Should return 0 (success)

## VERCEL FRONTEND DEPLOYMENT

### Step 2.9: Create D1 Database

**AI executes:**
```bash
npx wrangler d1 create PROJECT_NAME-db
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Successfully created DB 'PROJECT_NAME-db'

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "PROJECT_NAME-db"
database_id = "abc123-def456-ghi789-jkl012"
```

**AI must:**
1. Copy the entire `[[d1_databases]]` block
2. Store `database_id` value
3. Update `wrangler.toml`

**AI stores:**
```
D1_DATABASE_ID=abc123-def456-ghi789-jkl012
D1_DATABASE_NAME=PROJECT_NAME-db
```

---

### Step 2.10: Update wrangler.toml with D1 Config

**AI finds** `wrangler.toml` file (should be in project root)

**AI updates** or adds this section:
```toml
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "PROJECT_NAME-db"
database_id = "abc123-def456-ghi789-jkl012"
```

**AI verification:**
```bash
grep -A 3 "d1_databases" wrangler.toml
# Should show the configuration
```

---

### Step 2.11: Prepare Database Schema

**AI verifies** `schema.sql` file exists

**If not exists, AI creates** `schema.sql`:

      initialDelaySeconds: 30

# PostgreSQL database
databases:
  - name: PROJECT_NAME-db
    databaseName: PROJECT_NAME_production
    user: PROJECT_NAME_user
    plan: free
    region: oregon
```

**AI verification:**
```bash
test -f backend/render.yaml && echo "render.yaml created"
cat backend/render.yaml | grep -q "PROJECT_NAME-backend" && echo "Service name configured"
cat backend/render.yaml | grep -q "PROJECT_NAME-db" && echo "Database configured"
```

---

### Step 3.4: Update render.yaml with Actual Project Name

**AI replaces** all instances of `PROJECT_NAME` with actual project name:

```bash
cd backend
sed -i 's/PROJECT_NAME/actual-project-name/g' render.yaml
```

**AI verification:**
```bash
grep -c "PROJECT_NAME" render.yaml
# Should return 0 (no more placeholders)
```

wc -l backend/schema.sql
# Should show 200+ lines
```

---

## RENDER DEPLOYMENT

### Step 3.6: Commit Changes to Git

**AI must commit render.yaml and schema.sql:**

```bash
cd /path/to/project
git add backend/render.yaml backend/schema.sql
git commit -m "Add Render deployment configuration and PostgreSQL schema"
git push origin main
```

**AI verification:**
```bash
git log --oneline -1
# Should show the commit
```

---

### Step 3.7: Deploy to Render Using Blueprint

**AI executes:**
```bash
cd backend
render blueprint launch render.yaml
```

**Expected output:**
```
Creating services from blueprint...
✓ Creating database PROJECT_NAME-db
✓ Creating web service PROJECT_NAME-backend
✓ Linking database to web service

Your services:
  Web Service: https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com
  Database: PROJECT_NAME-db

Deployment in progress...
```

**Wait time:** 3-5 minutes for initial deployment

**User action:** None, just wait

**AI monitors deployment:**
```bash
render services list
```

**AI waits until status shows "live":**
```bash
while true; do
  STATUS=$(render services info PROJECT_NAME-backend --json | grep -o '"status":"[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4)
  echo "Status: $STATUS"
  if [ "$STATUS" = "live" ]; then
    break
  fi
  sleep 10
done
```

**AI stores:**
```
BACKEND_URL=https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com
RENDER_SERVICE_NAME=PROJECT_NAME-backend
RENDER_DATABASE_NAME=PROJECT_NAME-db
```

---

### Step 3.8: Get Database Connection String

**AI executes:**
```bash
render databases info PROJECT_NAME-db --json
```

**AI extracts Internal Database URL:**
```bash
DATABASE_URL=$(render databases info PROJECT_NAME-db --json | grep -o '"connectionString":"[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4)
echo $DATABASE_URL
```

**Expected format:**
```
postgresql://PROJECT_NAME_user:password@dpg-xxxxx.oregon-postgres.render.com:5432/PROJECT_NAME_production
```

**AI stores:**
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
```

---

## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES SETUP

### Step 3.9: Set JWT_SECRET in Render

**AI uses JWT_SECRET from PART 2:**

```bash
render env set JWT_SECRET="$JWT_SECRET" --service PROJECT_NAME-backend
```

**Expected output:**
```
✓ Successfully set environment variable JWT_SECRET
```

---

### Step 3.10: Set RESEND_API_KEY in Render

**AI uses RESEND_API_KEY from PART 1:**

```bash
render env set RESEND_API_KEY="$RESEND_API_KEY" --service PROJECT_NAME-backend
```

**Expected output:**
```
✓ Successfully set environment variable RESEND_API_KEY
```

---

### Step 3.11: Set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY in Render

**AI uses STRIPE_SECRET_KEY from PART 1:**

```bash
render env set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="$STRIPE_SECRET_KEY" --service PROJECT_NAME-backend
```

**Expected output:**
```
✓ Successfully set environment variable STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
```

---

### Step 3.12: Set TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN in Render

**AI uses TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN from PART 1:**

```bash
render env set TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN" --service PROJECT_NAME-backend
```

**Expected output:**
```
✓ Successfully set environment variable TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
```

---

### Step 3.13: Set Twilio Credentials (if enabled)

**If SMS verification enabled in PART 1:**

```bash
render env set TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="$TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID" --service PROJECT_NAME-backend
render env set TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="$TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN" --service PROJECT_NAME-backend
render env set TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER="$TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER" --service PROJECT_NAME-backend
```

---

### Step 3.14: Verify Environment Variables

**AI executes:**
```bash
render env list --service PROJECT_NAME-backend
```

**Expected output should include:**
```
JWT_SECRET=***
RESEND_API_KEY=***
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=***
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=***
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
CORS_ORIGINS=https://PROJECT_NAME.vercel.app
FRONTEND_URL=https://PROJECT_NAME.vercel.app
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10000
```

**If Twilio enabled:**
```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=***
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=***
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=***
```

**AI counts environment variables:**
```bash
render env list --service PROJECT_NAME-backend | wc -l
# Should be >= 10 (more if Twilio enabled)
```

---

## DATABASE MIGRATION

### Step 3.15: Connect to PostgreSQL Database

**AI executes:**
```bash
render postgres connect PROJECT_NAME-db
```

**Expected output:**
```
Connecting to PROJECT_NAME-db...
psql (15.x)
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256)
Type "help" for help.

PROJECT_NAME_production=>
```

**User sees:** PostgreSQL prompt

---

### Step 3.16: Run Database Migrations

**AI executes in psql prompt:**
```sql
\i schema.sql
```

**Expected output:**
```
CREATE EXTENSION
CREATE EXTENSION
CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE
... (many CREATE TABLE statements)
CREATE INDEX
CREATE INDEX
... (many CREATE INDEX statements)
CREATE FUNCTION
CREATE TRIGGER
CREATE TRIGGER
CREATE TRIGGER
INSERT 0 1
```

**AI verification in psql:**
```sql
\dt
```

**Expected output:**
```
                    List of relations
 Schema |          Name           | Type  |      Owner
--------+-------------------------+-------+-----------------
 public | audit_log               | table | PROJECT_NAME_user
 public | email_verifications     | table | PROJECT_NAME_user
 public | password_resets         | table | PROJECT_NAME_user
 public | payments                | table | PROJECT_NAME_user
 public | phone_verifications     | table | PROJECT_NAME_user
 public | sessions                | table | PROJECT_NAME_user
 public | subscriptions           | table | PROJECT_NAME_user
 public | telegram_conversations  | table | PROJECT_NAME_user
 public | telegram_messages       | table | PROJECT_NAME_user
 public | users                   | table | PROJECT_NAME_user
(10 rows)
```

**AI counts tables:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
```

**Expected result:**
```
 count
-------
    10
(1 row)
```

**AI exits psql:**
```sql
\q
```

---

### Step 3.17: Alternative Migration Method (if psql connection fails)

**If interactive psql doesn't work:**

**AI executes:**
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f backend/schema.sql
```

**Or using render CLI:**
```bash
render postgres query PROJECT_NAME-db --file backend/schema.sql
```

---

## BACKEND VERIFICATION

### Step 3.18: Trigger Render Deployment Restart

**After setting all environment variables, restart service:**

```bash
render services restart PROJECT_NAME-backend
```

**Expected output:**
```
✓ Successfully restarted PROJECT_NAME-backend
```

**Wait for restart (30-60 seconds):**
```bash
sleep 60
```

---

### Step 3.19: Check Backend Health Endpoint

**AI executes:**
```bash
curl https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/health/live
```

**Expected output:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-09T12:00:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 123.456
}
```

**AI verification:**
```bash
curl -s https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/health/live | grep -q '"status":"ok"'
# Should return 0 (success)
```

---

### Step 3.20: Check Database Connection

**AI executes:**
```bash
curl https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/health/ready
```

**Expected output:**
```json
{
  "ready": true,
  "database": "connected",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-09T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**AI verification:**
```bash
curl -s https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/health/ready | grep -q '"database":"connected"'
# Should return 0 (success)
```

---

### Step 3.21: View Backend Logs

**AI executes:**
```bash
render logs PROJECT_NAME-backend --tail 50
```

**AI looks for:**
- "Server running on port 10000"
- "PostgreSQL connected"
- "Health check endpoint ready"
- No error messages

**Expected log output:**
```
2025-01-09 12:00:00 [INFO] Server starting...
2025-01-09 12:00:01 [INFO] PostgreSQL connected
2025-01-09 12:00:01 [INFO] Server running on port 10000
2025-01-09 12:00:02 [INFO] Health check: OK
```

---

## UPDATE FRONTEND WITH BACKEND URL

### Step 3.22: Update Cloudflare Pages Environment Variable

**AI executes:**
```bash
npx wrangler pages project set PROJECT_NAME NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com"
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Successfully set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
```

---

### Step 3.23: Redeploy Frontend

**AI executes:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npx wrangler pages deploy .next --project-name=PROJECT_NAME
```

**AI waits for deployment (1-2 minutes)**

---

### Step 3.24: Verify Frontend Can Connect to Backend

**AI executes:**
```bash
curl -s https://PROJECT_NAME.vercel.app | grep -o 'https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com'
# Should find the backend URL in frontend code
```

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING RENDER ISSUES

### Issue: Blueprint deployment fails

**Check:**
```bash
render services list
render logs PROJECT_NAME-backend
```

**Solution:**
- Verify render.yaml syntax
- Check all environment variables
- Ensure package.json has correct scripts

---

### Issue: Database connection fails

**Check:**
```bash
render databases info PROJECT_NAME-db
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT 1"
```

**Solution:**
- Verify DATABASE_URL format
- Ensure DB_SSL=true is set
- Check if database is running

---

### Issue: Service won't start

**Check logs:**
```bash
render logs PROJECT_NAME-backend --tail 100
```

**Common causes:**
- Missing environment variables
- Wrong Node.js version
- Missing dependencies
- Port configuration issues

**Solution:**
- Set all required environment variables
- Specify Node version in package.json
- Run `npm install --production`
- Ensure PORT=10000 is set

# PART 4
## Email (Resend) and Payments (Stripe) Integration

Version: 4.0
Prerequisites: PART 1, 2, and 3 completed

---

## RESEND EMAIL INTEGRATION

### Step 4.1: Verify Resend API Key

**AI verifies key was set in PART 3:**
```bash
render env list --service PROJECT_NAME-backend | grep RESEND_API_KEY
```

**Expected output:**
```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_***
```

**AI also verifies in Cloudflare:**
```bash
npx wrangler secret list | grep RESEND_API_KEY
```

---

### Step 4.2: Test Resend API Connection

**AI executes test:**
```bash
curl https://api.resend.com/domains \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RESEND_API_KEY"
```

**Expected output:**
```json
{
  "data": []
}
```

**Or if domain already added:**
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "d91cd9bd-1176-453e-8fc1-35364d380206",
      "name": "yourdomain.com",
      "status": "verified",
      "created_at": "2025-01-09T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**AI verification:**
```bash
curl -s https://api.resend.com/domains -H "Authorization: Bearer $RESEND_API_KEY" | grep -q "data"
# Should return 0 (success)
```

---

### Step 4.3: Add Custom Domain to Resend (Optional but Recommended)

**AI asks user:**
```
Do you want to add a custom domain for sending emails?
This will make emails come from your domain instead of resend.dev
(yes/no)
```

**If yes:**

**AI asks:**
"What domain do you want to use for emails? (e.g., mail.yourdomain.com)"

**AI instructs user:**
```
1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter: mail.yourdomain.com
4. Click "Add"
5. You'll see DNS records to add
```

**AI provides DNS records user needs to add:**
```
You need to add these DNS records to Cloudflare:

SPF Record:
Type: TXT
Name: mail.yourdomain.com
Content: v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all

DKIM Record:
Type: TXT
Name: resend._domainkey.mail.yourdomain.com
Content: (copy from Resend dashboard)

DMARC Record:
Type: TXT
Name: _dmarc.mail.yourdomain.com
Content: v=DMARC1; p=none; pct=100; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com
```

**If user has Cloudflare account, AI can add records via API:**
```bash
# Get Zone ID
ZONE_ID=$(npx wrangler zones list | grep yourdomain.com | awk '{print $1}')

# Add SPF record
curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/dns_records" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "type": "TXT",
    "name": "mail.yourdomain.com",
    "content": "v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all"
  }'
```

**User must wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation, then:**

**AI instructs:**
```
Go back to Resend dashboard and click "Verify DNS Records"
```

---

### Step 4.4: Update EMAIL_FROM in Render

**If custom domain added:**
```bash
render env set EMAIL_FROM="noreply@mail.yourdomain.com" --service PROJECT_NAME-backend
```

**If using default:**
```bash
render env set EMAIL_FROM="onboarding@resend.dev" --service PROJECT_NAME-backend
```

---

### Step 4.5: Test Email Sending

**AI creates test endpoint (should already exist from generated code):**

Check if `backend/src/routes/test.js` exists:
```bash
test -f backend/src/routes/test.js && echo "Test routes exist"
```

**If not, AI creates it:**
```javascript
import express from 'express';
import { sendEmail, emailTemplates } from '../services/emailService.js';

const router = express.Router();

router.post('/test-email', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { email } = req.body;
    if (!email) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Email required' });
    }
    
    const result = await sendEmail({
      to: email,
      ...emailTemplates.welcome('Test User')
    });
    
    res.json({ 
      success: true, 
      id: result.id,
      message: 'Email sent successfully'
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});

export default router;
```

**AI commits and pushes:**
```bash
git add backend/src/routes/test.js
git commit -m "Add email testing endpoint"
git push origin main
```

**Wait for Render auto-deploy (2-3 minutes):**
```bash
sleep 180
```

**AI tests email sending:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/test/test-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com"}'
```

**Expected output:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "id": "49a3999c-0ce1-4ea6-ab68-afcd6dc2e794",
  "message": "Email sent successfully"
}
```

**AI verification:**
```bash
curl -s -X POST https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/test/test-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com"}' | grep -q '"success":true'
# Should return 0 (success)
```

**AI instructs user:**
```
Check the inbox of test@example.com for the welcome email.
If not received:
1. Check spam folder
2. Check Resend logs at https://resend.com/logs
3. Verify RESEND_API_KEY is correct
```

---

### Step 4.6: Verify Email Templates

**AI checks that emailService.js has all templates:**

```bash
grep -A 5 "emailTemplates" backend/src/services/emailService.js
```

**Should include:**
- welcome
- emailVerification
- passwordReset
- passwordChanged
- subscriptionCreated
- subscriptionCancelled
- paymentSucceeded
- paymentFailed

**AI verification:**
```bash
grep -c "export const emailTemplates" backend/src/services/emailService.js
# Should return 1 or more
```

---

## STRIPE PAYMENTS INTEGRATION

### Step 4.7: Verify Stripe Keys

**AI verifies keys were set in PART 3:**

**Backend (secret key):**
```bash
render env list --service PROJECT_NAME-backend | grep STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
```

**Expected output:**
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_***
```

**Frontend (publishable key):**
```bash
npx wrangler pages project list PROJECT_NAME
```

Should show `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

---

### Step 4.8: Test Stripe API Connection

**AI executes:**
```bash
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers?limit=1 \
  -u "$STRIPE_SECRET_KEY:"
```

**Expected output:**
```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [],
  "has_more": false,
  "url": "/v1/customers"
}
```

**AI verification:**
```bash
curl -s https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers?limit=1 -u "$STRIPE_SECRET_KEY:" | grep -q '"object":"list"'
# Should return 0 (success)
```

---

### Step 4.9: Create Stripe Products and Prices

**AI asks user:**
```
Do you want me to create test products and prices in Stripe?
(yes/no)
```

**If yes:**

**AI creates basic subscription plans via Stripe API:**

```bash
# Create product: Pro Plan
PRODUCT_ID=$(curl -s https://api.stripe.com/v1/products \
  -u "$STRIPE_SECRET_KEY:" \
  -d name="Pro Plan" \
  -d description="Professional subscription with all features" \
  | grep -o '"id":"prod_[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4)

echo "Product ID: $PRODUCT_ID"

# Create monthly price
PRICE_MONTHLY=$(curl -s https://api.stripe.com/v1/prices \
  -u "$STRIPE_SECRET_KEY:" \
  -d product="$PRODUCT_ID" \
  -d unit_amount=2000 \
  -d currency=usd \
  -d "recurring[interval]"=month \
  | grep -o '"id":"price_[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4)

echo "Monthly Price ID: $PRICE_MONTHLY"

# Create yearly price
PRICE_YEARLY=$(curl -s https://api.stripe.com/v1/prices \
  -u "$STRIPE_SECRET_KEY:" \
  -d product="$PRODUCT_ID" \
  -d unit_amount=20000 \
  -d currency=usd \
  -d "recurring[interval]"=year \
  | grep -o '"id":"price_[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4)

echo "Yearly Price ID: $PRICE_YEARLY"
```

**AI stores:**
```
STRIPE_PRODUCT_ID=prod_...
STRIPE_PRICE_MONTHLY=price_...
STRIPE_PRICE_YEARLY=price_...
```

**AI updates config file** `backend/src/config/stripe.js`:
```javascript
export const STRIPE_PRICES = {
  pro_monthly: 'price_...',
  pro_yearly: 'price_...',
};

export const STRIPE_PRODUCTS = {
  pro: 'prod_...',
};
```

**AI commits:**
```bash
git add backend/src/config/stripe.js
git commit -m "Add Stripe product and price IDs"
git push origin main
```

**If no:**

**AI instructs user:**
```
You can create products manually:
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products
2. Click "Add product"
3. Name: Pro Plan
4. Price: $20/month (or your price)
5. Recurring: Monthly
6. Click "Save product"
7. Copy the Price ID (starts with price_)
8. Update backend/src/config/stripe.js with the Price ID
```

---

### Step 4.10: Setup Stripe Webhook

**AI instructs user:**
```
We need to set up Stripe webhook for payment events.

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. Endpoint URL: https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/webhooks/stripe
4. Description: Payment webhooks
5. Events to send: Click "Select events"
6. Select these events:
   - checkout.session.completed
   - customer.subscription.created
   - customer.subscription.updated
   - customer.subscription.deleted
   - invoice.paid
   - invoice.payment_failed
   - payment_intent.succeeded
   - payment_intent.payment_failed
7. Click "Add events"
8. Click "Add endpoint"
9. Click on the webhook you just created
10. Click "Reveal" next to "Signing secret"
11. Copy the signing secret (starts with whsec_)
```

**AI asks:**
"Please paste your Stripe webhook signing secret (whsec_...):"

**AI stores** and sets in Render:
```bash
render env set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="$STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET" --service PROJECT_NAME-backend
```

**AI also sets in Cloudflare:**
```bash
echo "$STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET" | npx wrangler secret put STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
```

**AI verification:**
```bash
render env list --service PROJECT_NAME-backend | grep STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
# Should show: STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_***
```

---

### Step 4.11: Test Stripe Webhook Endpoint

**AI executes:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/webhooks/stripe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"test"}'
```

**Expected output:**
```json
{
  "error": "No signatures found"
}
```

**This is correct - webhook endpoint exists but rejects unsigned requests**

**AI verification:**
```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -X POST \
  https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/webhooks/stripe
# Should return 400 (Bad Request) not 404
```

---

### Step 4.12: Test Stripe Webhook from Dashboard

**AI instructs user:**
```
Let's test the webhook:

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks
2. Click on your webhook endpoint
3. Click "Send test webhook"
4. Select event: checkout.session.completed
5. Click "Send test webhook"
6. You should see a "200 OK" response
```

**AI checks backend logs:**
```bash
render logs PROJECT_NAME-backend --tail 20 | grep webhook
```

**Expected log:**
```
Webhook received: checkout.session.completed
Processing checkout session...
```

---

### Step 4.13: Create Test Checkout Session

**AI creates test route (if not exists):**

```javascript
router.post('/test-checkout', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const session = await createCheckoutSession({
      priceId: 'price_...', // Use STRIPE_PRICE_MONTHLY
      userId: 'test-user-123',
      customerEmail: 'test@example.com'
    });
    
    res.json({ 
      url: session.url,
      id: session.id
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});
```

**AI tests:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/test/test-checkout \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Expected output:**
```json
{
  "url": "https://checkout.stripe.com/c/pay/cs_test_...",
  "id": "cs_test_..."
}
```

**AI verification:**
```bash
curl -s -X POST https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/test/test-checkout \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" | grep -q "https://checkout.stripe.com"
# Should return 0 (success)
```

**AI instructs user:**
```
Test the checkout flow:
1. Open this URL in browser: [checkout URL from above]
2. Use test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
3. Expiry: Any future date
4. CVC: Any 3 digits
5. Complete the checkout
6. You should be redirected to success page
7. Check Stripe dashboard for the payment
```

---

### Step 4.14: Verify Stripe Integration in Database

**AI connects to database:**
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM subscriptions"
```

**After user completes test checkout, should show:**
```
 count
-------
     1
(1 row)
```

**AI also checks:**
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT * FROM subscriptions LIMIT 1"
```

**Should show subscription record with:**
- stripe_subscription_id
- stripe_customer_id
- status = 'active'
- plan name
- current_period_start/end

---

## INTEGRATION VERIFICATION

### Step 4.15: Test Full User Registration Flow with Email

**AI creates test script:**

```bash
# Register user
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email":"testuser@example.com",
    "password":"Test1234!",
    "name":"Test User"
  }')

echo "Registration response: $RESPONSE"

# Extract user ID and token
USER_ID=$(echo $RESPONSE | grep -o '"id":"[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4)
TOKEN=$(echo $RESPONSE | grep -o '"token":"[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4)

echo "User ID: $USER_ID"
echo "Token: $TOKEN"
```

**Expected:**
1. User created in database
2. Welcome email sent automatically
3. JWT token returned

**AI verifies database:**
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT email, name, email_verified FROM users WHERE email='testuser@example.com'"
```

**Expected output:**
```
       email          |   name    | email_verified
----------------------+-----------+----------------
 testuser@example.com | Test User | f
(1 row)
```

**AI instructs user:**
```
Check testuser@example.com inbox for welcome email.
Email should arrive within 1-2 minutes.
```

---

### Step 4.16: Test Email Verification Flow

**AI creates verification token:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/send-verification \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Verification email sent"
}
```

**AI instructs user:**
```
1. Check testuser@example.com inbox
2. Find "Verify your email" email
3. Click verification link
4. Should redirect to app with success message
```

---

### Step 4.17: Test Password Reset Flow

**AI triggers password reset:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/forgot-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"testuser@example.com"}'
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Password reset email sent"
}
```

**AI instructs user:**
```
1. Check testuser@example.com inbox
2. Find "Reset your password" email
3. Click reset link
4. Should redirect to password reset page

# Should return 200
```

---

### Step 5.6: Create Test Telegram Conversation

**AI instructs user:**
```
Let's test the Telegram bot:

1. Open Telegram app
2. Search for: @project_support_bot (use your bot's username)
3. Click on the bot
4. Click "Start" or send /start
5. Bot should respond with welcome message

Expected response:
"Welcome to Project Support!

I can help you with:
- Account registration
- Support requests
- Status updates

Available commands:
/help - Show this message
/register - Link your account
/support - Contact support
/status - Check account status"
```

**User action:** Start conversation with bot

**AI checks backend logs:**
```bash
render logs PROJECT_NAME-backend --tail 20 | grep telegram
```

**Expected logs:**
```
Telegram webhook received
Processing /start command
User: testuser (123456789)
Sending welcome message
```

---

### Step 5.7: Test Bot Commands

**AI instructs user to test each command:**

**/help command:**
```
User sends: /help
Bot responds with: Help information and available commands
```

**/register command:**
```
User sends: /register
Bot responds with: Instructions to link account or registration link
```

**/support command:**
```
User sends: /support
Bot responds with: "Please describe your issue. A support agent will respond shortly."
Creates support ticket in database
```

**/status command:**
```
User sends: /status
Bot responds with: Account status or "You haven't registered yet"
```

**AI verifies conversations in database:**
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM telegram_conversations"
```

**Should show at least 1 conversation:**
```
 count
-------
     1
(1 row)
```

**AI checks conversation details:**
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT telegram_chat_id, status FROM telegram_conversations ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1"
```

**Expected:**
```
 telegram_chat_id |  status
------------------+---------
 123456789        | open
(1 row)
```

---

### Step 5.8: Test Account Linking via Telegram

**AI creates account link endpoint (should exist in generated code):**

Check `backend/src/routes/telegram.js`:
```bash
test -f backend/src/routes/telegram.js && echo "Telegram routes exist"
```

**AI tests account linking flow:**

**User (in Telegram):** Sends `/register`

**Bot responds with:** 
```
To link your account, please click this link:
https://PROJECT_NAME.vercel.app/telegram/link?token=abc123...

Or reply with your email address.
```

**AI verifies link token created:**
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT token FROM telegram_link_tokens ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1"
```

**User clicks link and logs in on website:**
```bash
# Test the link endpoint
curl https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/telegram/link \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "token": "abc123...",
    "userId": "user-uuid"
  }'
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Account linked successfully"
}
```

**AI verifies user updated in database:**
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT telegram_id, telegram_username FROM users WHERE telegram_id IS NOT NULL"
```

**Should show linked account:**
```
 telegram_id | telegram_username
-------------+------------------
 123456789   | testuser
(1 row)
```

---

### Step 5.9: Test Support Ticket Creation

**AI instructs user:**
```
In Telegram, send: /support
Then send: "I need help with my account"
```

**Expected flow:**
1. User sends `/support`
2. Bot: "Please describe your issue"
3. User sends message
4. Bot: "Your support ticket #123 has been created"
5. Database: New conversation and messages created

**AI verifies in database:**
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT id, status FROM telegram_conversations WHERE status='open'"
```

**AI checks messages:**
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT from_user, content FROM telegram_messages ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5"
```

**Expected:**
```
 from_user |           content
-----------+------------------------------
 user      | I need help with my account
 support   | Your ticket has been created
 user      | /support
(3 rows)
```

---

### Step 5.10: Test Admin Notification

**When support ticket created, admin should receive notification:**

**AI checks if admin user exists:**
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT email, telegram_id FROM users WHERE role='admin'"
```

**If admin has telegram_id, bot sends notification:**

**AI checks logs:**
```bash
render logs PROJECT_NAME-backend --tail 50 | grep "admin notification"
```

**Expected log:**
```
Sending admin notification for ticket #123
Admin notified via Telegram
```

---

## TWILIO SMS INTEGRATION (Optional)

### Step 5.11: Check if SMS Enabled

**AI checks:**
```bash
render env list --service PROJECT_NAME-backend | grep TWILIO
```

**If TWILIO variables exist, continue with SMS setup**
**If not, skip to Step 5.19**

---

### Step 5.12: Verify Twilio Credentials

**AI checks all Twilio variables:**
```bash
render env list --service PROJECT_NAME-backend | grep TWILIO
```

**Expected output:**
```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=AC***
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=***
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1***
```

---

### Step 5.13: Test Twilio API Connection

**AI executes:**
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/$TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID.json" \
  -u "$TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID:$TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN"
```

**Expected output:**
```json
{
  "sid": "AC...",
  "friendly_name": "Account Name",
  "status": "active",
  "type": "Full"
}
```

**AI verification:**
```bash
curl -s -X GET "https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/$TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID.json" \
  -u "$TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID:$TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN" | grep -q '"status":"active"'
# Should return 0 (success)
```

---

### Step 5.14: Test SMS Sending

**AI creates test endpoint (should exist):**

Check `backend/src/routes/test.js`:
```bash
grep -q "test-sms" backend/src/routes/test.js && echo "SMS test route exists"
```

**AI tests SMS sending:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/test/test-sms \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"phone\":\"+1234567890\"}"
```

**Expected output:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "sid": "SM...",
  "message": "Test SMS sent successfully"
}
```

**AI verification:**
```bash
curl -s -X POST https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/test/test-sms \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"phone\":\"+1234567890\"}" | grep -q '"success":true'
# Should return 0 (success)
```

**AI instructs user:**
```
Check your phone for test SMS.
If using trial account, phone must be verified in Twilio console.
```

---

### Step 5.15: Test Phone Verification Flow

**AI tests complete phone verification:**

**Step 1: Request verification code**
```bash
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/phone/send-code \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"phone":"+1234567890"}')

echo $RESPONSE
```

**Expected output:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Verification code sent",
  "expiresIn": 300
}
```

**AI instructs user:**
```
Check your phone for verification code SMS.
Code format: 6 digits (e.g., 123456)
Code expires in 5 minutes.
```

**Step 2: Verify code**
```bash
curl -X POST https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/phone/verify-code \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "phone":"+1234567890",
    "code":"123456"
  }'
```

**Expected output:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Phone verified successfully"
}
```

**AI verifies in database:**
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT phone, phone_verified FROM users WHERE phone='+1234567890'"
```

**Expected:**
```
     phone      | phone_verified
----------------+----------------
 +1234567890    | t
(1 row)
```

---

### Step 5.16: Test SMS Rate Limiting

**AI tests multiple SMS sends:**
```bash
for i in {1..5}; do
  curl -s -X POST https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/phone/send-code \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_TOKEN" \
    -d '{"phone":"+1234567890"}'
  sleep 1
done
```

**Expected:**
- First 2-3 requests: Success
- Subsequent requests: Rate limit error

**Expected error after rate limit:**
```json
{
  "error": "Too many verification attempts. Please try again later."
}
```

**AI verification:**
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM phone_verifications WHERE phone='+1234567890' AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'"
```

**Should show limited number of attempts**

---

### Step 5.17: Test SMS in Registration Flow

**AI tests new user registration with phone:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email":"smsuser@example.com",
    "password":"Test1234!",
    "name":"SMS Test User",
    "phone":"+1234567890"
  }'
```

**Expected:**
1. User created
2. Welcome email sent
3. Phone verification SMS sent automatically

**AI checks logs:**
```bash
render logs PROJECT_NAME-backend --tail 20 | grep "SMS"
```

**Expected logs:**
```
User registered: smsuser@example.com
Sending phone verification SMS to +1234567890
SMS sent successfully: SM...
```

---

### Step 5.18: Verify SMS Templates

**AI checks SMS service has all templates:**
```bash
grep -A 5 "smsTemplates" backend/src/services/smsService.js
```

**Should include:**
- phoneVerification
- passwordReset
- loginAlert
- subscriptionReminder

---

## TELEGRAM AND SMS VERIFICATION

### Step 5.19: Complete Integration Test

**AI runs full integration test:**

**Test 1: User registers with phone**
```bash
curl -X POST https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email":"fulltest@example.com",
    "password":"Test1234!",
    "name":"Full Test User",
    "phone":"+1234567890"
  }'
```

**Expected:**
- User created
- Email sent (welcome)
- SMS sent (verification code)
- Database record created

**Test 2: User links Telegram**
```
User opens Telegram bot
User sends: /register
User clicks link or enters email
Account linked
```

**Expected:**
- telegram_id updated in users table
- User can now receive support via Telegram

**Test 3: User verifies phone**
```bash
# Assuming user received code "123456"
curl -X POST https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/phone/verify-code \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "phone":"+1234567890",
    "code":"123456"
  }'
```

**Expected:**
- phone_verified = true
- SMS confirmation sent

**Test 4: User creates support ticket**
```
User sends in Telegram: /support
User sends: "Test support ticket"
```

**Expected:**
- Support ticket created
- Admin notified (if admin has Telegram)
- Conversation stored in database

**AI verifies all in database:**
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" << 'EOF'
SELECT 
  u.email,
  u.email_verified,
  u.phone_verified,
  u.telegram_id IS NOT NULL as telegram_linked,
  COUNT(tc.id) as support_tickets
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN telegram_conversations tc ON tc.user_id = u.id
WHERE u.email = 'fulltest@example.com'
GROUP BY u.id, u.email, u.email_verified, u.phone_verified, u.telegram_id;
EOF
```

**Expected output:**
```
       email         | email_verified | phone_verified | telegram_linked | support_tickets
---------------------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+----------------
 fulltest@example.com| t              | t              | t               | 1
(1 row)
```

---

### Step 5.20: Test Notification Delivery

**AI tests all notification channels:**

**Email notification:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/test/test-notification \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId":"user-uuid",
    "type":"email",
    "message":"Test notification"
  }'
```

**Telegram notification (if user has telegram_id):**
```bash
curl -X POST https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/test/test-notification \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId":"user-uuid",
    "type":"telegram",
    "message":"Test notification"
  }'
```

**SMS notification (if user has verified phone):**
```bash
curl -X POST https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/test/test-notification \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId":"user-uuid",
    "type":"sms",
    "message":"Test notification"
  }'
```

**Expected:**
- All three channels deliver notification
- User receives message via email, Telegram, and SMS

## COMPLETE SYSTEM VERIFICATION

### Step 6.1: Health Checks - All Services

**AI runs comprehensive health check:**

**Backend health:**
```bash
curl https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/health/live
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-09T12:00:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 3600,
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

**Database health:**
```bash
curl https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/health/ready
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "ready": true,
  "database": "connected",
  "redis": "connected",
  "services": {
    "email": "ok",
    "sms": "ok",
    "stripe": "ok",
    "telegram": "ok"
  }
}
```

**Frontend health:**
```bash
curl -I https://PROJECT_NAME.vercel.app
```

**Expected:**
```
HTTP/2 200
content-type: text/html
...
```

**AI verification script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
BACKEND_URL="https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com"
FRONTEND_URL="https://PROJECT_NAME.vercel.app"

echo "Checking backend health..."
BACKEND_STATUS=$(curl -s $BACKEND_URL/api/health/live | grep -o '"status":"ok"')
if [ -z "$BACKEND_STATUS" ]; then
  echo "❌ Backend health check failed"
  exit 1
else
  echo "✅ Backend is healthy"
fi

echo "Checking database..."
DB_STATUS=$(curl -s $BACKEND_URL/api/health/ready | grep -o '"database":"connected"')
if [ -z "$DB_STATUS" ]; then
  echo "❌ Database connection failed"
  exit 1
else
  echo "✅ Database is connected"
fi

echo "Checking frontend..."
FRONTEND_STATUS=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" $FRONTEND_URL)
if [ "$FRONTEND_STATUS" != "200" ]; then
  echo "❌ Frontend is not accessible"
  exit 1
else
  echo "✅ Frontend is accessible"
fi

echo ""
echo "All health checks passed! ✅"
```

---

### Step 6.2: Database Integrity Check

**AI verifies all tables exist:**
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" << 'EOF'
SELECT 
  table_name,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = t.table_name) as column_count
FROM information_schema.tables t
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE'
ORDER BY table_name;
EOF
```

**Expected output (10 tables):**
```
       table_name        | column_count
-------------------------+--------------
 audit_log               | 9
 email_verifications     | 6
 password_resets         | 6
 payments                | 7
 phone_verifications     | 8
 sessions                | 7
 subscriptions           | 10
 telegram_conversations  | 7
 telegram_messages       | 5
 users                   | 16
(10 rows)
```

**AI counts total rows:**
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" << 'EOF'
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  n_live_tup as row_count
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;
EOF
```

**AI verifies indexes:**
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_indexes WHERE schemaname = 'public'"
```

**Should show 30+ indexes**

---

### Step 6.3: Environment Variables Audit

**AI creates audit script:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "=== Render Backend Environment Variables ==="
render env list --service PROJECT_NAME-backend | grep -v "^$"

echo ""
echo "=== Cloudflare Secrets ==="
npx wrangler secret list

### Step 6.6: Test Error Handling

**AI tests error scenarios:**

**Invalid credentials:**
```bash
curl -s -X POST https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"wrong@example.com","password":"wrong"}'
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid credentials"
}
```

**Missing required fields:**
```bash
curl -s -X POST https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com"}'
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "error": "Missing required fields",
  "required": ["email", "password", "name"]
}
```

**Invalid token:**
```bash
curl -s -X GET https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/users/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid_token"
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid or expired token"
}
```

**Rate limiting:**
```bash
for i in {1..20}; do
  curl -s -X POST https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/login \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"wrong"}' &
done
wait
```

**Expected:** Some requests return rate limit error

---

## FRONTEND TESTING

### Step 6.7: Test Frontend Routes

**AI tests all frontend pages:**

```bash
FRONTEND_URL="https://PROJECT_NAME.vercel.app"

echo "Testing frontend routes..."

# Homepage
echo "- Homepage"
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" $FRONTEND_URL
# Expected: 200

# Login page
echo "- Login page"
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" $FRONTEND_URL/login
# Expected: 200

# Register page
echo "- Register page"
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" $FRONTEND_URL/register
# Expected: 200

# Dashboard (should redirect if not authenticated)
echo "- Dashboard"
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" $FRONTEND_URL/dashboard
# Expected: 200 or 302

# Pricing page
echo "- Pricing"
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" $FRONTEND_URL/pricing
# Expected: 200

# 404 page
echo "- 404 page"
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" $FRONTEND_URL/nonexistent
# Expected: 404
```

---

### Step 6.8: Test Frontend API Integration

**AI verifies frontend can communicate with backend:**

```bash
# Check if frontend has correct API URL
curl -s $FRONTEND_URL | grep -o "PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com"
# Should find the backend URL

# Check if Stripe publishable key is present
curl -s $FRONTEND_URL | grep -o "pk_test_[a-zA-Z0-9]*"
# Should find Stripe key
```

---

### Step 6.9: Browser Testing Checklist

## PERFORMANCE TESTING

### Step 6.10: Load Testing

**AI creates simple load test:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
BACKEND_URL="https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com"

echo "Running load test..."
echo "Testing health endpoint with 100 concurrent requests"

for i in {1..100}; do
  (curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" $BACKEND_URL/api/health/live) &
done

wait

echo "Load test complete"
```

**AI checks response times:**
```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "Time: %{time_total}s\n" \
  https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/health/live
```

**Expected:** < 1 second for health endpoint

---

### Step 6.11: Database Performance Check

**AI checks query performance:**
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" << 'EOF'
-- Enable timing
\timing on

-- Test index usage
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';

-- Test join performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT u.email, COUNT(tc.id) as ticket_count
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN telegram_conversations tc ON tc.user_id = u.id
GROUP BY u.id, u.email;

-- Test pagination
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM audit_log 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 50 OFFSET 0;
EOF
```

**AI verifies indexes are being used (should see "Index Scan" not "Seq Scan")**

---

## CUSTOM DOMAIN SETUP (OPTIONAL)

### Step 6.12: Frontend Custom Domain

**AI asks user:**
```
Do you want to set up a custom domain for the frontend?
(yes/no)
```

**If yes:**

**AI asks:** "What domain do you want to use? (e.g., app.yourdomain.com)"

**AI instructs user:**
```
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → Pages
2. Select PROJECT_NAME project
3. Click "Custom domains" tab
4. Click "Set up a custom domain"
5. Enter: app.yourdomain.com
6. Click "Activate domain"

Cloudflare will automatically:
- Add DNS records
- Issue SSL certificate
- Configure redirects

This takes 2-5 minutes.
```

**After domain is active:**

**AI updates backend CORS:**
```bash
render env set CORS_ORIGINS="https://app.yourdomain.com,https://PROJECT_NAME.vercel.app" --service PROJECT_NAME-backend
render env set FRONTEND_URL="https://app.yourdomain.com" --service PROJECT_NAME-backend
```

**AI updates Stripe webhook allowed origins (if needed)**

---

### Step 6.13: Backend Custom Domain

**AI asks:**
```
Do you want to set up a custom domain for the backend?
(yes/no)
```

**If yes:**

**AI asks:** "What domain do you want to use? (e.g., api.yourdomain.com)"

**AI instructs user:**
```
1. Go to Render Dashboard → Services
2. Select PROJECT_NAME-backend
3. Click "Settings" tab
4. Scroll to "Custom Domain"
5. Click "Add Custom Domain"
6. Enter: api.yourdomain.com
7. Click "Save"

Render will show DNS instructions:
Add CNAME record in Cloudflare:
  Type: CNAME
  Name: api.yourdomain.com
  Target: PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com
```

**AI can add DNS record via Cloudflare API:**
```bash
# Get Zone ID
ZONE_ID=$(npx wrangler zones list | grep yourdomain.com | awk '{print $1}')

# Add CNAME record
curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/dns_records" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "type": "CNAME",
    "name": "api.yourdomain.com",
    "content": "PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com",
    "ttl": 1,
    "proxied": false
  }'
```

**Wait for SSL certificate (2-10 minutes)**

**After domain is active:**

**AI updates frontend environment variable:**
```bash
npx wrangler pages project set PROJECT_NAME \
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="https://api.yourdomain.com"
```

**Rebuild and redeploy frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npx wrangler pages deploy .next --project-name=PROJECT_NAME
```

# Restart backend
render services restart PROJECT_NAME-backend
```

**If SSL issue:**
```bash
# Ensure DB_SSL is set to true
render env set DB_SSL="true" --service PROJECT_NAME-backend

# Verify in connection code:
# ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }
```

**If connection limit reached:**
```bash
# Check active connections
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active'"

# Free tier limit: 20 connections
# Solution: Close connections properly in code

render logs PROJECT_NAME-backend | grep -i "email"

# Check Resend dashboard
# https://resend.com/logs
```

**Common causes:**
1. Wrong API key
2. Domain not verified
3. Email in spam
4. Rate limit reached

**Solutions:**

**If wrong API key:**

curl https://api.telegram.org/bot$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN/getWebhookInfo

# Check backend logs
render logs PROJECT_NAME-backend | grep -i "telegram"
```

**Common causes:**
1. Wrong bot token
2. Webhook not set
3. Backend endpoint not working
4. Bot blocked or restricted

**Solutions:**

**If wrong bot token:**
```bash
# Get correct token from @BotFather
# /token command

# Update in Render
render env set TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="correct_token" --service PROJECT_NAME-backend

# Update in Cloudflare
echo "correct_token" | npx wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN

# Set webhook again
curl -X POST https://api.telegram.org/bot$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN/setWebhook \
  -d "url=https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/webhooks/telegram"
```

**If webhook not set:**
```bash
# Set webhook
curl -X POST https://api.telegram.org/bot$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN/setWebhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com/api/webhooks/telegram"}'

# Verify
curl https://api.telegram.org/bot$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN/getWebhookInfo
```

**Test bot:**
```
1. Open Telegram
2. Find your bot
3. Send /start
4. Should receive response
5. Check backend logs if no response
```

## MONITORING AND LOGS

### Monitoring Setup

**Backend monitoring:**
```bash
# Real-time logs
render logs PROJECT_NAME-backend --tail

# Last 100 lines
render logs PROJECT_NAME-backend --tail 100

# Save logs to file
render logs PROJECT_NAME-backend --tail 1000 > logs.txt

# Filter for errors
render logs PROJECT_NAME-backend | grep -i "error"
```

**Frontend monitoring:**
```bash
# Deployment logs
npx wrangler pages deployment list --project-name=PROJECT_NAME

# Tail logs
npx wrangler pages deployment tail --project-name=PROJECT_NAME
```

**Database monitoring:**
```bash
# Connection count
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_stat_activity"

# Database size
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(current_database()))"

# Table sizes
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS size
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC
"

# Slow queries
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "
SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY mean_time DESC
LIMIT 10
"
```

---

### Health Check Script

**AI creates monitoring script:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# save as: monitor.sh

BACKEND_URL="https://PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com"
FRONTEND_URL="https://PROJECT_NAME.vercel.app"

echo "=== Health Check $(date) ==="

# Backend
echo "Backend:"
BACKEND_STATUS=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" $BACKEND_URL/api/health/live)
if [ "$BACKEND_STATUS" = "200" ]; then
  echo "  ✅ Healthy (HTTP $BACKEND_STATUS)"
else
  echo "  ❌ Unhealthy (HTTP $BACKEND_STATUS)"
  # Send alert (email, Telegram, etc.)
fi

# Database
echo "Database:"
DB_STATUS=$(curl -s $BACKEND_URL/api/health/ready | grep -o '"database":"connected"')
if [ -n "$DB_STATUS" ]; then
  echo "  ✅ Connected"
else
  echo "  ❌ Disconnected"
fi

# Frontend
echo "Frontend:"
FRONTEND_STATUS=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" $FRONTEND_URL)
if [ "$FRONTEND_STATUS" = "200" ]; then
  echo "  ✅ Accessible (HTTP $FRONTEND_STATUS)"
else
  echo "  ❌ Not accessible (HTTP $FRONTEND_STATUS)"
fi

# Response time
echo "Response times:"
BACKEND_TIME=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{time_total}" $BACKEND_URL/api/health/live)
echo "  Backend: ${BACKEND_TIME}s"
FRONTEND_TIME=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{time_total}" $FRONTEND_URL)
echo "  Frontend: ${FRONTEND_TIME}s"

echo ""
```

**Run every 5 minutes via cron:**
```bash
chmod +x monitor.sh

# Add to crontab
crontab -e

# Add line:
*/5 * * * * /path/to/monitor.sh >> /path/to/monitor.log 2>&1
```

---

## BACKUP AND RESTORE

### Database Backup

**Manual backup:**
```bash
# Using Render CLI
render postgres backup PROJECT_NAME-db

# Using pg_dump
pg_dump "$DATABASE_URL" > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Compress
gzip backup_*.sql
```

**Automated backup script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# save as: backup.sh

BACKUP_DIR="$HOME/backups"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
DB_URL="$DATABASE_URL"

mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

echo "Starting backup at $TIMESTAMP"

# Backup database
pg_dump "$DB_URL" > "$BACKUP_DIR/backup_$TIMESTAMP.sql"

# Compress
gzip "$BACKUP_DIR/backup_$TIMESTAMP.sql"

# Delete backups older than 7 days
find "$BACKUP_DIR" -name "backup_*.sql.gz" -mtime +7 -delete

echo "Backup completed: $BACKUP_DIR/backup_$TIMESTAMP.sql.gz"
```

**Automated via cron (daily at 2 AM):**
```bash
chmod +x backup.sh

crontab -e

# Add:
0 2 * * * /path/to/backup.sh >> /path/to/backup.log 2>&1
```

---

### Database Restore

**Restore from backup:**
```bash
# Decompress
gunzip backup_20250109_020000.sql.gz

# Restore
psql "$DATABASE_URL" < backup_20250109_020000.sql

# Or use Render CLI
render postgres restore PROJECT_NAME-db --backup-id=BACKUP_ID
```

**Restore specific table:**
```bash
# Extract specific table from backup
pg_restore -t table_name backup.sql > table_backup.sql

# Restore specific table
psql "$DATABASE_URL" < table_backup.sql
```

---

## UPDATES AND REDEPLOYMENT

### Backend Updates

**Deploy code changes:**
```bash
# Make changes to code
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update: description"
git push origin main

# Render auto-deploys (if enabled)
# Or manual deploy:
render deploy --service PROJECT_NAME-backend

# Monitor deployment
render logs PROJECT_NAME-backend --tail
```

**Update dependencies:**
```bash
cd backend
npm update
npm audit fix

# Test locally
npm run dev

# Commit and push
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "Update dependencies"
git push origin main
```

---

### Frontend Updates

**Deploy code changes:**
```bash
cd frontend

# Make changes
# Test locally
npm run dev

# Build
npm run build

# Deploy
npx wrangler pages deploy .next --project-name=PROJECT_NAME

# Or commit and push (if auto-deploy enabled)
git add .
git commit -m "Update: description"
git push origin main
```

---

### Database Schema Updates

**Adding new table:**
```sql
-- Create migration file: migrations/002_add_new_table.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS new_table (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_new_table_name ON new_table(name);
```

**Run migration:**
```bash
# Test locally first
psql "$DATABASE_URL_LOCAL" -f migrations/002_add_new_table.sql

# Run on production
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f migrations/002_add_new_table.sql

# Or via Render
render postgres query PROJECT_NAME-db --file migrations/002_add_new_table.sql
```

**Adding new column:**
```sql
-- migrations/003_add_user_column.sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS new_field VARCHAR(255);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_new_field ON users(new_field);
```

**Always test migrations on backup first!**

## SECURITY MAINTENANCE

### Regular Security Tasks

**Weekly:**
- [ ] Review access logs
- [ ] Check for failed login attempts
- [ ] Verify backup completed
- [ ] Check disk usage

**Monthly:**
- [ ] Update dependencies (npm update)
- [ ] Review and rotate API keys if needed
- [ ] Check SSL certificate expiry (auto-renewed)
- [ ] Audit user accounts
- [ ] Review database access logs

**Quarterly:**
- [ ] Change admin password
- [ ] Review all environment variables
- [ ] Audit third-party integrations
- [ ] Review rate limiting rules
- [ ] Check for unused services

---

### Security Audit Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# save as: security-audit.sh

echo "=== Security Audit $(date) ==="

# Check failed logins (last 24h)
echo "Failed login attempts (24h):"
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "
SELECT COUNT(*) as failed_attempts
FROM audit_log
WHERE action = 'login_failed'
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
"

# Check admin accounts
echo "Admin accounts:"
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT email, created_at FROM users WHERE role = 'admin'"

# Check environment variables set
echo "Environment variables:"
REQUIRED_VARS=(DATABASE_URL JWT_SECRET RESEND_API_KEY STRIPE_SECRET_KEY)
for var in "${REQUIRED_VARS[@]}"; do
  if render env list --service PROJECT_NAME-backend | grep -q "$var"; then
    echo "  ✅ $var"
  else
    echo "  ❌ $var MISSING"
  fi
done

# Check SSL
echo "SSL Certificate:"
echo | openssl s_client -servername PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com \
  -connect PROJECT_NAME-backend.onrender.com:443 2>/dev/null | \
  openssl x509 -noout -dates

echo ""
```

---

## PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

### Database Optimization

**Analyze queries:**
```sql
-- Find slow queries
SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY total_time DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Find missing indexes
SELECT schemaname, tablename, attname, n_distinct, correlation
FROM pg_stats
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND n_distinct > 100
  AND correlation < 0.1;

-- Vacuum and analyze
VACUUM ANALYZE;
```

**Add indexes for slow queries:**
```sql
-- Example: If users.email lookups are slow
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_email_lookup ON users(email) WHERE is_active = true;

-- Example: If date range queries are slow
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_log_date_range ON audit_log(created_at DESC) WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

---

### Backend Optimization

**Enable caching:**
```javascript
// Add to backend
import { createClient } from 'redis';

const redis = createClient({
  url: process.env.REDIS_URL
});

// Cache frequently accessed data
async function getCachedData(key, fetchFn, ttl = 3600) {
  const cached = await redis.get(key);
  if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);
  
  const data = await fetchFn();
  await redis.setex(key, ttl, JSON.stringify(data));
  return data;
}
```

**Optimize queries:**
```javascript
// Bad: N+1 query problem
for (const user of users) {
  const posts = await db.query('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id = $1', [user.id]);
}

// Good: Join or batch query
const users = await db.query(`
  SELECT u.*, json_agg(p.*) as posts
  FROM users u
  LEFT JOIN posts p ON p.user_id = u.id
  GROUP BY u.id
`);
```
